The NBA is going global, and it's not going to stop. Here's why international faces are taking over the league.

   <h1>
    The globalization of the NBA is upon us. On the league’s opening night of the 2024-25 season, about 28 percent of rostered players came from outside the United States, tying a league record. Non-American players are not just filling rosters but are also becoming superstars and changing the way the game is played in America.

    The NBA has had an international presence since its inception. The first game ever was played in Canada when the Toronto Huskies hosted the New York Knicks, with Toronto’s roster featuring Italian-born Hank Biassati and German-born Charlie Hoefer.

   <h3>
From this early era through the 1980s, there was some representation of foreign-born players, but there were also multiple years when the league was made up entirely of Americans. During these few decades, most non-American players had come to the United States as children or young adults to play college basketball. NBA teams actively scouting internationally in the 1980s, '90s, and into the 21st century has led to an explosion of international influence in the game.
   </h3>

   <div class = "superstars">
    <h3>
        Since then, many international players have become superstars. In 1994, Hakeem Olajuwon became the first non-American player to win MVP, and Canadian Steve Nash and German Dirk Nowitzki went back-to-back with the award in 2006 and 2007.
    </h3>
    <h3>
        Now, American players are on an MVP drought. With Canadian Shai Gilgeous-Alexander of the Oklahoma City Thunder as the overwhelming favorite to win the 2025 MVP, the league is close to seeing seven straight seasons with international-born MVPs. Serbian Nikola Jokić has three in that span, while Greek Giannis Antetokounmpo has two and Cameroonian Joel Embiid has one.

        <h2>
            The NBA’s group of international players also has significant depth. Seven of this year’s 2025 All-Stars were from countries other than the United States. This group featured multiple young up-and-coming stars, including Turkish-born Alperen Şengün and France’s Victor Wembanyama. This is a significant change from the All-Star game 50 years ago — where no international players were selected.
        </h2>

<h3>
    The international representation among today’s superstars is not just a fun fact but likely affecting the NBA’s gameplay as well. For example, Nowitzki helped revolutionize the power forward position by being one of the first to rely heavily on mid-range and three-point shooting. That playing style, known as the “stretch four,” is now common in the league.
</h3>

<h3>
    Specifically, European styles of basketball tend to feature more ball movement and less focus on the individual. We see these styles in the NBA's best international players. For example, Serbian three-time MVP Jokić averages over 10 assists per game this year, which was previously unheard of for a seven-foot player.
</h3>

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/22163554"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script><noscript><img src="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/22163554/thumbnail" width="100%" alt="chart visualization" /></noscript></div>

<h3>
    Increased international basketball talent isn’t just beneficial for the NBA, it is also helping create a more competitive product at the Olympics. 
While Team USA did emerge victorious at the 2024 Paris Games, the Americans — which was made up of the best American talent in the NBA — had a tight final against France, erased a 15-point second half deficit against Serbia in the semi-final and a number of close exhibition games on their way to gold. These tighter matchups are likely a result of 10 out of the 12 teams in the Olympic field having at least four current or former NBA players on their rosters.

</h3>
<h3>
    As is the case with any sport, international representation increases the talent pool in the NBA, so the league is almost certainly more talented than it was decades ago.

    <h2>
        Methodology:
    </h2>

    <p>
        For the International NBA players map, we took the list of the international players on 2024-25 opening Day rosters from <a href = "https://www.nba.com/news/2024-25-international-players-opening-night-rosters-official-release"> NBA.com </a> and put it into a <a href = "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NPiS-mLCpQv4BurLQD5Td877l9Qu9eCQ8Xr_Xfd0uJE/edit?gid=0#gid=0"> google sheet </a>. From there we searched up the hometown of each player to get the coordinates to put points in the map. Then we also checked which current team to update the list from NBA.com which was published in the fall. There has been some movement from that date due to trades and players getting cut. Then once all the data was in the google sheet, we created a pivot table to determine how many players each country had. That allowed us to create parameters in Flourish to show which country other than the USA had the most players. 
    </p>

    <p>
        For the All Star map, we took the roster from All Star games going back to 1975 – 50 years ago— from <a href = "https://www.basketball-reference.com/allstar/"> Basketball Reference. </a> Since adding 50 years of that data manually would take ages we decided to use five year intervals to show the change over the time. This involved us searching up the all star rosters and then adding the players’s hometown, home country and team at the time for each player into a <a href = "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Gnxh3K-YYeTtRqsrIC9IdS97k0-0vTMAKxpay2iShY8/edit?gid=0#gid=0"> spreadsheet. </a> From there we took the coordinates from each hometown to add points on an animation map in Flourish. Thanks to having a wide set of years, we were able to show the change over time— which showed significantly more international players in the all-star game in the last 20 years compared to the 1970s, 80’s and 90s
    </p>

    <p>
        For the NBA international players line graph, the data was collected from <a href = "https://www.basketball-reference.com/friv/birthplaces.fcgi"> Basketball Reference </a> and inputted into a <a href = https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NXOhaeeBnhAVqeLsJGpmY5_x7RBdPouMEts-tSczpfs/edit?gid=0#gid=0"> Google Sheet </a>. Each player was divided into the year he started his career, beginning four decades ago in 1984. That data was then entered into a pivot table to obtain the counta of the number of players per year. The pivot table was then downloaded into a CSV and imported into Flourish to be visualized. 
    </p>

    <p>
        In the graph with current and former NBA players in the Paris Olympics, we just searched for the players on <a href = https://www.nba.com"> NBA.com.</a> We also included the former players with the current to give credit. There were several players throughout the rosters that had played a few seasons in the league that now play overseas in different countries. We focused on the Olympics because the Olympics involve athletes from all over the world.
    </p>

    <p>
        For the parts about European influence on NBA we referenced a few articles including this one one College Insider. For the information on the first-ever NBA game we referenced NBA.com and Basketball Reference. For the background on NBA’s international player pool and scouting we used an article on Yahoo Sports.
