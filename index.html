    The globalization of the NBA is upon us. On the league’s opening night of the 2024-25 season, about 28 percent of rostered players came from outside the United States, tying a league record. Non-American players are not just filling rosters but are also becoming superstars and changing the way the game is played in America.

    The NBA has had an international presence since its inception. The first game ever was played in Canada when the Toronto Huskies hosted the New York Knicks, with Toronto’s roster featuring Italian-born Hank Biassati and German-born Charlie Hoefer.
   </h3>

   <h3>
    From this early era through the 1980s, there was some representation of foreign-born players, but there were also multiple years when the league was made up entirely of Americans. During these few decades, most non-American players had come to the United States as children or young adults to play college basketball. NBA teams actively scouting internationally in the 1980s, '90s, and into the 21st century has led to an explosion of international influence in the game.

    <h3>
        Since then, many international players have become superstars. In 1994, Hakeem Olajuwon became the first non-American player to win MVP, and Canadian Steve Nash and German Dirk Nowitzki went back-to-back with the award in 2006 and 2007.
    </h3>
    <h3>
        Now, American players are on an MVP drought. With Canadian Shai Gilgeous-Alexander of the Oklahoma City Thunder as the overwhelming favorite to win the 2025 MVP, the league is close to seeing seven straight seasons with international-born MVPs. Serbian Nikola Jokić has three in that span, while Greek Giannis Antetokounmpo has two and Cameroonian Joel Embiid has one.

            The NBA’s group of international players also has significant depth. Seven of this year’s 2025 All-Stars were from countries other than the United States. This group featured multiple young up-and-coming stars, including Turkish-born Alperen Şengün and France’s Victor Wembanyama.

<h3>
    The international representation among today’s superstars is not just a fun fact but likely affecting the NBA’s gameplay as well. For example, Nowitzki helped revolutionize the power forward position by being one of the first to rely heavily on mid-range and three-point shooting. That playing style, known as the “stretch four,” is now common in the league.
</h3>

<h3>
    Specifically, European styles of basketball tend to feature more ball movement and less focus on the individual. We see these styles in the NBA's best international players. For example, Serbian three-time MVP Jokić averages over 10 assists per game this year, which was previously unheard of for a seven-foot player.
</h3>

<h3>
    As is the case with any sport, international representation increases the talent pool in the NBA, so the league is almost certainly more talented than it was decades ago.
