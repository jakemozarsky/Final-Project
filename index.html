    The globalization of the NBA is upon us. On the league’s opening night of the 2024-25 season, about 28 percent of rostered players came from outside the United States, tying a league record. Non-American players are not just filling rosters but are also becoming superstars and changing the way the game is played in America.

    The NBA has had an international presence since its inception. The first game ever was played in Canada when the Toronto Huskies hosted the New York Knicks, with Toronto’s roster featuring Italian-born Hank Biassati and German-born Charlie Hoefer.

   <h3>
    From this early era through the 1980s, there was some representation of foreign-born players, but there were also multiple years when the league was made up entirely of Americans. During these few decades, most non-American players had come to the United States as children or young adults to play college basketball. NBA teams actively scouting internationally in the 1980s, '90s, and into the 21st century has led to an explosion of international influence in the game.
